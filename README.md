# Chl-a-codes

This code is modified from a previous version of WOMBAT-lite. The main difference relative to the earlier implementation is the removal of the final adjustment step, which was designed to simulate photoacclimation but tended to overestimate chlorophyll synthesis under low-light, high-nutrient conditions. Additionally, the PI slope for chlorophyll a is limited to a maximum fivefold increase under high nutrient limitation.
