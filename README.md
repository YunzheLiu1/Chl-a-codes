# Chl-a-codes

This code is modified from a previous version of WOMBAT-lite. The main difference relative to the earlier implementation is the removal of the final adjustment step, which was designed to limit photoacclimation but tended to overestimate chlorophyll synthesis under low-light, high-nutrient conditions.
